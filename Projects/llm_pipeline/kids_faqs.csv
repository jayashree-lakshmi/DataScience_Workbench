Questions,Response
Why is the Earth oval-shaped and not round?	,"Earth isn’t a perfect sphere because it spins. This spinning causes the middle (equator) to bulge slightly, making Earth an oblate spheroid."
Why is the Moon white in color?	,The Moon looks white because it reflects sunlight. Its surface is made of light-colored dust and rocks that bounce back sunlight evenly.
Why does water turn into ice?	,"Water turns into ice when it gets cold enough—below 0°C. The molecules slow down and lock into a solid structure, forming ice crystals."
Why do stars twinkle?	,"Stars twinkle because their light passes through Earth’s atmosphere, which is full of moving air. This bends the light and makes it flicker.
"
Why do we have seasons?	,Seasons happen because Earth is tilted as it orbits the Sun. Different parts of Earth get more sunlight at different times of the year.
Why is the sky blue?,"Sunlight has all colors, but blue light scatters more in the atmosphere. That’s why we see a blue sky during the day."
Why do plants need sunlight?	,"Plants use sunlight to make food through a process called photosynthesis. Without sunlight, they can’t grow or survive."
Why do volcanoes erupt?	,Volcanoes erupt when pressure builds up from hot molten rock (magma) inside Earth. It pushes through cracks and explodes out.
Why do we see rainbows?	,"Rainbows happen when sunlight passes through raindrops. The light bends and splits into different colors, creating a rainbow.
"
Why do birds fly and humans can't?	,"Birds have lightweight bodies, strong chest muscles, and wings designed for flight. Humans are too heavy and don’t have wings or hollow bones."
How do airplanes fly? ,"Airplanes fly because of lift, a force created by their wings as air moves over and under them, generating different air pressures"
What is the Sun's main job?,The Sun is the primary source of energy for Earth. 
How much does the earth weigh?,"The earth weighs 13,170,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 pounds. You can say this number like this: 13 octillion, 170 septillion. That’s A LOT more than a million, billion, or trillion pounds!

To put things in perspective:

One male African bush elephant weighs 13,000 pounds.
100 elephants would weigh 1,300,000 (one million, 300 thousand) pounds.
One million elephants would weigh 13,000,000,000 (13 trillion) pounds.
One trillion elephants–there are not even this many on earth–would weigh 13,000,000,000,000,000 (13 quintillion) pounds.
And still, earth weighs one billion times more than that!

How do scientists know how much the earth weighs? They study the gravitational pull the earth has on other objects, and use math to calculate how big the earth must be."
How do flies walk on the ceiling?,Flies can walk upside down! They can do this because of their sticky feet
How are rainbows made?,"A rainbow is formed when light hits water droplets in the air and is refracted, or bent."
can I see the moon during the day?,"Yes,The moon is the brightest object in the night sky. During the day, the sun is much brighter! But sometimes, you can see the moon during the daytime."
Why do birds fly south for the winter?,Many birds fly south in the winter. Birds that eat nectar or insects will not be able to find food in areas that have cold winters.
Why does milk get foamy when you boil it?,"Milk is full of tiny things like proteins and fat. When you heat it up, the water in the milk starts turning into steam. The proteins and fat float to the top and make a thin layer—kind of like a blanket. That blanket traps the steam underneath, and the steam pushes up little bubbles. Those bubbles make the foam!

It can happen if you eat too fast, laugh a lot, or even drink fizzy drinks. Most hiccups go away on their own, but holding your breath or sipping water slowly can help too!"
